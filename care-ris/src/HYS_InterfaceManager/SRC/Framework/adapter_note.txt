Adapter Service:

installutil HYS.Adapters.Service.exe
installutil /u HYS.Adapters.Service.exe

These two assemblies should be exactly the same, or you can not uninstall the service.

Does it have anything to do with weak named assembly? What if they are strong named assemably?

However, sometimes it works well.

-------------------------------------------

Adapter Config:

Consider to combine FormConfigIn and FormConfigOut into one form...

-------------------------------------------

Adapter Service:

IAdapter.Exit() won't not be call untill operation system is shut down. Is that all right?

-------------------------------------------

Adapter Service:

FindWindow
ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS
183 Cannot create a file when that file already exists. 

Solution: 

In order for a Windows service to obtain the handle of the running IM it needs to be able to interact with the desktop. 
This is done by editing the service properties and checking the 'Allow service to interact with desktop' button.
