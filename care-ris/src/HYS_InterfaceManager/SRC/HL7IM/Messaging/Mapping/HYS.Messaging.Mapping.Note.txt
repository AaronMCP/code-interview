What is the Messaging.Mapping namespace?

(2011/02/25)

This namespace contains message processing utilities, 
such as (XML) message transforming, validating, encrypting 
and (text) value encoding, replacing, translating, 
as well as UI helper for message processing configuration or unit testing.

In the future, we will try to provide a message processing pipeline,
which can be configured, reused and embeded into message entities.
It is something like the MessagePipe component in XDSGW 1.1,
but much simpler than that.

However, currently we found that AOP model applied on the push and pull channel
may be more suitable to the message processing scenario.
For details, please refer to IDuplexProcessChannel and IOneWayProcessChannel 
in Messaging.Objects.ProcessModel namespace.
It is much more lightweight than the pipeline, 
more suitable to be implemented in the framework level.
If you really need a pipline anyway, 
it is also OK to modify the XSLT script to include multiple XSLT files.
However, message schema validation and other things like that,
may also be added into the AOP model in the future.
